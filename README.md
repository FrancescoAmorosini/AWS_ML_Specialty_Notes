# AWS_ML_Specialty_Notes - Disclaimer ⚠️
This repository accomodates my own markdown notes that I worte while preparing the AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certification.
While reading through the notes, you should keep in mind that:

* The notes are messy in some parts. I started writing them several months ago with just some AWS exam's answers that I got wrong while taking some practice tests.
* My notes are not meant to be studied for taking the certification exam. They contain no basics nor general knowledge on machine learning, but rather a bunch of quibbles and specific topics that I find difficult to remember. For example, I will not explain how PCA works, but I will make comparisons between PCA, t-SNE, and LDA.
* In spite of the previous point, every section contains at least one hyperlink to articles that I deemed worthy of notice. Such articles are often very detailed and will provide you with the general knowledge on the topic that you might be looking for. Often times, the articles have been ripped off for writing my own notes in order to allow for a faster lookup.
In general, I suggest you to look for the concerned topic on the Table of Contents, read through the article that I linked, and eventually read my notes that will most likely focus on the most tricky part.
* Feel free to Fork/PR this repository and contribute with your own notes!
* [This Markdown render](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) is suggested for correctly displaying the notes and all the equations.
* Also, if you have installed the VSCode Extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), you can run a VSCode Task to display the notes in your default browser (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > `Tasks: Run Task` > `Run All`). This will host the notes as a static web page on `http://127.0.0.1:5500`. 

Enjoy your learning! :)

## Update: 17-10-2022

**Yesterday I passed the exam!**

<img style="background-color:#ffff; text-align:center;" width="200" src="https://images.credly.com/size/220x220/images/778bde6c-ad1c-4312-ac33-2fa40d50a147/image.png" />

So here are some hot comments on my experience:
* On the top of my notes I suggest some study material. I highly suggest to buy the Whizlabs and Udemy test exams, since **some questions in my exam were exactly the same**.
* There are about 20 questions that are free (if you know the topic), 20 that are challenging, and 20 that are quite hard.
* Since the passing thereshold is about 75%, if you want to pass the exam you **must** have attended some AI/ML course at some point in your life. And I mean a real academic course with maths, statistics, and laboratories. *Coursera won't save your ass for this one, nor this notes will.*
