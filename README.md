# AWS_ML_Specialty_Notes - Disclaimer ⚠️
This repository accomodates my own markdown notes that I worte while preparing the AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certification.
While reading through the notes, you should keep in mind that:

* The notes are messy in some parts. I started writing them several months ago with just some AWS exam's answers that I got wrong while taking some practice tests.
* My notes are not meant to be studied for taking the certification exam. They contain no basics nor general knowledge on machine learning, but rather a bunch of quibbles and specific topics that I find difficult to remember. For example, I will not explain how PCA works, but I will make comparisons between PCA, t-SNE, and LDA.
* In spite of the previous point, every section contains at least one hyperlink to articles that I deemed worthy of notice. Such articles are often very detailed and will provide you with the general knowledge on the topic that you might be looking for. Often times, the articles have been ripped off for writing my own notes in order to allow for a faster lookup.
In general, I suggest you to look for the concerned topic on the Table of Contents, read through the article that I linked, and eventually read my notes that will most likely focus on the most tricky part.
* Feel free to Fork/PR this repository and contribute with your own notes!

Enjoy your learning! :)
